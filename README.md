Projects

    Content Delivery Network: Built a DNS server using Python that redirects the clients based on information such as geolocation to the web servers deployed on Amazon EC2 instances (replica servers). Implemented a HTTP server which returns the content requested by the client either from cache or from the origin server.Also, implemented a cache replacement strategy that deletes the least frequently requested content
    Automatic Essay Grader: Developed a system using Python, that automates the task of grading essays using natural language processing tools. The model is trained using a set of features and then linear regression is applied to calculate the score. The model gives an accuracy of 75%.
    Disease Prediction Using Clustering Techniques: Developed a system using Java and R programming that predicts the diseases that a demographic is most likely to suffer from to help Governmental Health departments predict changing trends and take preventive measures to address diseases. Processed streams of semantic data (RDF format) and converted it to structured data to apply data mining algorithm for predictive analysis.
